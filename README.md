# Garden_plan
Python square matrix problem solution with Numpy
In this project we are given a square matrix of a garden plan. Each integer(positive, negative or zero) in the matrix represents the maintenance work the tree requires. In order to divide work more or less equally between employees the garden owner decides to divide the garden into 4 rectangular parts in such way that the total maintenance of the trees differs as little as possible from one part to another. First the path between northern and southern parts of the garden needs to be built. Then the northern part is divided into north-western (NW) and north-eastern (NE) parts by a path. Finally, the path is built to divide south-western (SW) and south-eastern (SE) parts.
The objective is to divide the garden into rectangles in such way that the difference in total maintenance of each part is as low as possible. We need to provide the maximum difference in maintenance of the best solution, the total maintenance of each part and the coordinates of each rectangular part.
